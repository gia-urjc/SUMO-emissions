# SUMO Emissions Simulator 

## Introduction

The purpose of this simulator is to use the SUMO traffic simulation tool with Python to research systems that restrict and control access to an urban area in order to maintain the pollution in that area below some admissible threshold.

The simulator offers us the possibility to execute situations using different configurations: # TODO

Here you'll find all the necessary documentation to use and develop new features in the SUMO Emissions Simulator.

## For Developers
If you are a developer or researcher and wants to create new things for the simulator, you should start here. 

### Prerequisites

1. It should work on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

2. SUMO - Simulation of Urban MObility

   Download: https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/
   Version 1.7.0
   Next versions may work

3. Python

   https://www.python.org/
   Version 3.8
   Next versions may work
   
4. IDE Pycharm or similar

   Community : Free
   Professional: Free if you are a student https://www.jetbrains.com/education/ 
   
5. Git

Please make sure that all the binaries are registered in your PATH.

### Getting Started for Development

- You should always run main.py because it is necessary to run TraCI for simulation. 
- TraCI is the SUMO Traffic Control Interface: https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/TraCI.html
