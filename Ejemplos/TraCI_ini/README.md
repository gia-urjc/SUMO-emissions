# TraCI:Traffic control interface. 
It's an API that gives us access to running sumo simulation. It uses a TCP based client-server architecture to provide access to SUMO. 

Giving access to a running road traffic simulation, it allows to retrieve values of simulated objects and to manipulate their behavior "on-line".
